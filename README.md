PC skill1 cfg file - intentionally blank;
put the files in the CFG package at SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg;
(make a duplicate of your cfg package before moving the test files);
!!!important!!!;
If you have a lot of content installed from the workshop (campaigns, models, etc.), the configuration may work with problems, to solve this problem, move the files directly to a clean game, without using some mods;
the configuration will work correctly on all servers and in all modes.
